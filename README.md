## General Information

In this project, nested forms are used to create one-way flight bookings for multiple passengers per booking. The user selects a flight departure and destination and as well as date to view the flights available. This is achieved by setting up a search that utilizes multiple parameters.

Later, [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) was used to add some dynamic behavior to the booking form. A button was added to add additional passengers to the booking as well as a button to remove passengers from the booking form.
